Project Description

This project aims to analyze a dataset of laptops and predict their prices based on various features such as screen size, CPU frequency, RAM, and more. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and identify correlations between features. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict laptop prices.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about laptops, including:

- Company
- Product
- TypeName
- Inches (screen size)
- ScreenResolution
- CPU_Company
- CPU_Type
- CPU_Frequency (GHz)
- RAM (GB)
- Memory
- GPU_Company
- GPU_Type
- OpSys
- Weight (kg)
- Price (Euro)

Data Source
-Kaggle

Goals

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data.
2. Identify correlations between features.
3. Train a machine learning model to predict laptop prices.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model.

Methods

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
3. Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)
4. Machine learning modeling using Scikit-learn
5. Model evaluation using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared

Deliverables

1. A Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA and machine learning code
2. A report summarizing the findings and results
3. A trained machine learning model that can predict laptop prices
